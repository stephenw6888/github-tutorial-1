## Git vs. GitHub

_Git and Github_ are the **essential coding system** throughout Github. But as the name suggest, they are both differ among each other. 

_Git_ is a independent control made to have version control. (Keeping Snapshots) (_DOESN'T NEED GITHUB_) 

* Git keeps Snapshots of your work while Github shows your changings
* Runs throughout **command line**
* Basic workflow include (Initial Setup, Creating Repository, Edit files, Add files, Commiting files)

_Github_ is a dependent control requiring _Git_. (_REQUIRE GITHUB_)

* Github also stores your work into the cloud Git works on the command line
* Github can help you easily collaborate on files Github requires git but git doesn't require git
* Runs on the **command line**
* With basic work flow

1. Intial Repository created by yourself
or
2. Fork and Clone someone else's repository
